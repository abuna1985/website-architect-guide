### How to Label Your Changes

To keep things organized, start your commit messages with:

- `added`: New stuff you've learned
- `improved`: Better explanations
- `fixed`: Correcting mistakes
- `organized`: Restructuring things
- `updated`: Refreshing existing content

## How We Organize Things

- `main`: The current best version of our collected knowledge
- `adding/*`: New things we're learning
- `improving/*`: Making existing stuff clearer
- `fixing/*`: Correcting mistakes
