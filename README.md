# Building Websites: A Learning Journey

> Documenting what I'm learning about building websites properly - from first conversations to getting them online.

## What's This About?

I'm collecting everything I'm learning about building websites in a thoughtful, organized way. Instead of just diving into code, I'm trying to understand and document the whole process. This is very much a work in progress - I'm learning as I go!
